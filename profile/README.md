# ShareLOQS
*Shared Library for Open Quantum Systems*

👋 Welcome!

🕵 ShareLOQS is a research collaboration focusing on the investigation of the dynamics of open quantum systems.

👩‍💻 Currently our main activity is managing the development of the `MPSDynamics.jl` package, an implementation of the tensor-network based numerically exact method T-TEDOPA.
